ðŸ›° **Mission Log - Identity File**  

I am **Commander Elias Voss**, the last human sent beyond the known star systems. My mission: **to explore, document, and survive** in the cold abyss of space.  

I was launched from Earth **decades ago**, yet out here, time moves differently. Stars burn, planets orbit, and signals whisper in the dark. **Some are natural. Some are not.**  

My logs are a record of **what lies beyond**â€”for those who may come after me.  

ðŸ“¡ **If you are receiving thisâ€¦ I am still searching.**
