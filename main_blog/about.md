ðŸ›° **Mission Log â€“ Murphy Cooper**  

_"Weâ€™ve always looked to the stars and wondered, but now Iâ€™m out here, and Iâ€™m the one wondering if anyoneâ€™s looking back."_  

My name is **Murphy Cooper**, daughter of a man who once left Earth to save it. Now, I continue his journey, pushing beyond the boundaries of time, space, and understanding.  

Earth is fadingâ€”a distant memory, a place bound by gravity and time. But I am **not bound**. Out here, among the stars, I follow the echoes of those who came before meâ€¦ and those who **never returned**.  

Something is waiting beyond the void. Something **we were never meant to find**.  

I will not stop searching. **Not yet.**  

ðŸ“¡ **If youâ€™re receiving thisâ€¦ time is still on my side.**
