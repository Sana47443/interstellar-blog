🛸 Log 1: First Steps on Proxima B

📅 Sol 1

📍 Proxima Centauri System, Surface of Proxima B

I have landed. The terrain is rugged, silent, and alien. The red glow from Proxima Centauri casts long, eerie shadows across the rocky surface. Thin air, cold winds, and no signs of life—yet.

The soil analysis shows high iron content, possibly a sign of past geological activity. Water ice exists deep underground, but extracting it will be difficult.

One anomaly stands out—a faint signal on my comms. It repeats at exact intervals. A natural phenomenon? Or something more? I will investigate soon.

For now, I must secure my habitat before nightfall.

End Log.
