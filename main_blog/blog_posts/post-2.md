🌠 Log 2: The Strange Echo

📅 Sol 3

📍 Proxima B, 15km West of Landing Site

The signal has grown stronger. It is not random—it follows a pattern. I have traced it to a rocky outcrop where my scanners detect an unnatural metallic presence beneath the surface.

The sand here vibrates softly, almost as if something responds to my movements.

I am setting up my drilling equipment. I don’t know what I’ll find, but something tells me—I am not the first visitor to this world.
